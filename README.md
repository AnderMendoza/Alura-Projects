<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

In this repository I insert all the projects that I have done in the course of my training within the ONE program by [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/) in collaboration with [Alura](https://www.aluracursos.com/). Here you can find projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. The route I have chosen is that of Front-End developer, so the projects and exercises seen here are in relation to that route. With this I seek to organize and present the development of my training process as proof of my hard work and commitment to this great opportunity to which I agreed.

Oracle Next Education es un programa de educación, empleabilidad e inclusión 100% gratuito, creado para ofrecer formación de calidad a personas que no han contado con oportunidades para continuar sus estudios y desarrollar una carrera profesional.
The program equips students with technical and behavioral skills to act as Jr. Developer, a professional who works to create and improve websites, software, and applications, and prepares them for a job opportunity.

By completing the mandatory steps of the course, the student has access to the vacancy platform, allowing him to participate in the selection processes of collaborating companies.

For more information about the program you can review 👉[here](https://www.oracle.com/pe/education/oracle-next-education/#about-course)👈

<!-- ALURA LATAM -->

Alura is the online arm of Caelum, a renowned school of technology and innovation in Brazil.
The founders, Paulo Silveira and Guilherme Silveira, realized that many students had an interest in their courses only that they did not have access to our content due to distance and time. Thus, the online platform was born in 2011, with the success of the project they created their own brand Alura in June 2013.
